As of PHP 5.5.0 mysql_real_escape_string and the mysql extension are deprecated. Please use mysqli extension and mysqli::escape_string function instead

To use the parameterized query, you need to use MySQLi rather than the MySQL functions. To rewrite your example, we would need something like the following.

<?php
    $mysqli = new mysqli("server", "username", "password", "database_name");

    // TODO - Check that connection was successful.

    $unsafe_variable = $_POST["user-input"];

    $stmt = $mysqli->prepare("INSERT INTO table (column) VALUES (?)");

    // TODO check that $stmt creation succeeded

    // "s" means the database expects a string
    $stmt->bind_param("s", $unsafe_variable);

    $stmt->execute();

    $stmt->close();

    $mysqli->close();
?>


Using PDO (for any supported database driver):

$stmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = :name');

$stmt->execute(array('name' => $name));

foreach ($stmt as $row) {
    // do something with $row
}
Using MySQLi (for MySQL):

$stmt = $dbConnection->prepare('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = ?');
$stmt->bind_param('s', $name);

$stmt->execute();

$result = $stmt->get_result();
while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
    // do something with $row
}
